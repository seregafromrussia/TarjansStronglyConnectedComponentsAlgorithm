# Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm
## Description
Tarjan's algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph. It runs in linear time, matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm.
* Input: adjacency matrix
* Output: list of strongly connected components

## Build from source

### Requirements
* java 8
* maven

## Pseudocode

    input: graph G = (V, E)

                // Note: The next line may look odd - but is correct.
                // It says w.index not w.lowlink; that is deliberate and from the original paper
