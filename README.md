# Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm
## Description
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)

Tarjan's algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph. It runs in linear time, matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm.
* Input: adjacency matrix
* Output: list of strongly connected components

## Build from source

### Requirements

## Pseudocode
algorithm tarjan is
    input: graph G = (V, E)
    output: set of strongly connected components (sets of vertices)
   
    index := 0
    S := empty stack
    for each v in V do
        if v.index is undefined then

        for each (v, w) in E do
            if w.index is undefined then

                // If w is not on stack, then (v, w) is an edge pointing to an SCC already found and must be ignored
                // Note: The next line may look odd - but is correct.
                // It says w.index not w.lowlink; that is deliberate and from the original paper
                v.lowlink := min(v.lowlink, w.index)
            end if
        end for
      
        // If v is a root node, pop the stack and generate an SCC
        if v.lowlink = v.index then
            start a new strongly connected component
            repeat
                w := S.pop()
                w.onStack := false
                add w to current strongly connected component
            while w ≠ v
            output the current strongly connected component
